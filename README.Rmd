`r verbadge`

**wakefield** is designed to quickly generate random data sets.  The user passes `n` (number of rows) and predefined vectors to the `r_data_frame` function to produce a `dplyr::tbl_df` object.

## Installation

To download the development version of **wakefield**:

Download the [zip ball](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install the development version:

```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/wakefield")
```

## Demonstration

The `r_data_frame` function (random data frame) takes `n` (the number of rows) and any number of variables (columns).  These columns are typically produced from a **wakefield** variable function.  Each of these variable functions has a pre-set behavior that produces a named vector of n length, allowing the user to lazily pass unnamed functions (optionally, without call parenthesis).  The column name is hidden as a `varname` attribute.  For example here we see the `race` variable function:

```{r}
race(n=10)
attributes(race(n=10))
```

When this variable is used inside of `r_data_frame` the `varname` is used as a column name.  Additionally, the `n` argument is not set within variable functions but is set once in `r_data_frame`:

```{r}
r_data_frame(
    n = 500,
    race
)
```

The power of `r_data_frame` is apparent when we use many modular variable functions:

```{r}
r_data_frame(
    n = 500,
    id,
    race,
    age,
    sex,
    hour,
    iq,
    height,
    died
)
```


There are a plethora of **wakefield** based variable functions to chose from, spanning **R**'s various data types. However, the user may also pass their own vector producing functions or vectors to `r_data_frame`.  Those with an `n` argument can be set by `r_data_table`:

```{r}
r_data_frame(
    n = 500,
    id,
    Scoring = rnorm,
    Smoker = valid,
    race,
    age,
    sex,
    hour,
    iq,
    height,
    died
)
```

While, passing variable functions to `r_data_frame` without call parenthesis is handy the user may wish to set arguments.  This can be done through call parenthesis as we do with `data.frame` or `dplyr::data_frame`:

```{r}
r_data_frame(
    n = 500,
    id,
    Scoring = rnorm,
    Smoker = valid,
    `Reading(mins)` = rpois(lambda=20),  
    race,
    age(x = 8:14),
    sex,
    hour,
    iq,
    height(mean=50, sd = 10),
    died
)
```

## Random Missing Observations

Often data contains missing values.  **wakefield** allows the user to add a proportion of missing values per column/vector via the `r_na` (random `NA`).  This works nicely within a **dplyr**/**magrittr** `%>%` *then* pipeline:

```{r}
r_data_frame(
    n = 30,
    id,
    race,
    age,
    sex,
    hour,
    iq,
    height,
    died,
    Scoring = rnorm,
    Smoker = valid
) %>%
    r_na(prob=.4)
```
