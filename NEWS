wakefield 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `employment` was misspelled as `empoyment`.  Caught by Danilo Freire (issue #2).

NEW FEATURES

* `r_list` & `r_data_frame` now add a suffix to repeat variable names in a
  sensible way.  The separator is controlled by `rep.sep`.  Suggested by
  Ananda Mahto.  See issue #1 for details.

* `r_list` and `r_data_frame` can utilize `r_series` and `r_dummy` to produce
  series of variables. Suggested by Ananda Mahto.  See issue #1 for details.

* `r_series` added to produce a series of grouped data.  This is useful for
  simulating repeated measures or survey questions.  Suggested by Ananda Mahto.
  See issue #1 for details.

* `as_integer` added as a means of coercing all columns of a `factor`
  `data.frame` to `integer`s.

* `r_dummy` added to produce multiple dummy columns from a single factor.

* `dob` and `birth` functions added for date of birth variable.

* `peek` added to allow a truncated head inspection of all columns of a
  `data.frame`.

* `table_heat` & `plot.tbl_df` added to visualize column types & `NA`s.

* `r_insert` added to safely insert `data.frame`s into a `r_data_frame` or
  `r_list` object.

* `military` added as a random military branch varaible function.

MINOR FEATURES

* `seriesname` function added to give a `data.frame` an attribute `seriesname`.
  Typicaly this is for internal use.
